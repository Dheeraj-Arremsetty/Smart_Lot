# Smart_Lot
#
# When the frustration of leaving early to just drive endlessly looking for an available 
# spot get to you.  This Smart IoT device network helps correct this problem using real-time
# data collection and manipulation to deliver helpful analytics that can remove this frustration
# and hassle from your life.
#
# WHAT IT DOES
#---------------------
# Smart_Lot uses a smart IoT device to record entrance and exit from any parking structure.  
# It uses a two-point validation (pressure-pad & photoresistor) to detect cars from humans 
# and to detect if the car is coming or going from the parking structure.  The smart IoT
# device then post that data to a central analytics engine and database.  While in the database
# inputs will be processed to produce useful information from the recordings.  At, anytime a
# mobile application or web application can query the database to recieve real-time analytics.
#
# 
# CHALLENGES
#------------------
# Smart_Lot wasn't easy from the beginning.  We have had challenges such as creating an Iot 
# device that was smart enough to account for user cases that would break it and to make the IoT be
# able to distinguish between coming anf going from a parking structure.  Then we were tasked with
# connecting this smart IoT device to a central analytics engine.  This analytics engine also had 
# to be accessible to web applications to could retrive the data being stored there.
#
# ACCOMPLISHMENTS
# ------------------
# Making an IoT device that was smart by design.  A device that could account for misuse without
# use of code decreasing complexity by just using intellegent design.

# What's Next for UMSL Hack?
#--------------------------------
# Creating solutions to creating and changing college life at UMSL to improve the experince not only
# for the students but also for the community as a whole.
